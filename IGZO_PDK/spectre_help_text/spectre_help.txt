*   -uwifmt <name> 
                  Specifies a user-defined output format. To specify multiple formats, use `:' as a delimiter. This option is valid only when the
                  waveform format is set to uwi by using the -format option.
*   -uwilib <lib> Specifies the absolute path to the user-defined output format library. This option is used with `-uwifmt'. Use `:' as the
                  delimiter to specify more than one library.

    +sensdata <file> 
                  Sends the sensitivity analyses data to the specified file.
*   +multithread  Enables the multithreading capability. When specified, the Spectre simulator automatically detects the number of processors and
                  assigns the appropriate number of threads to use.  (see the 'options' help page for more information on using multithreading).
                  '+mt' can be used as an abbreviation of '+multithread'.
*   +multithread=<N> 
                  Enables the multithreading capability, where, N is the number of threads specified. A maximum of 64 threads are allowed. '+mt'
                  can be used as an abbreviation of '+multithread'.

                  used as an abbreviation of '-multithread'.
*   +mtmode=value Selects the multithreading mode. Possible values are 'passive' and 'active'.
    -processor    Sets the CPU affinity of a process similar to the Linux 'taskset' command. It specifies a numerical list of processors that can
                  contain multiple items, separated by comma. For example, '-processor 0-3,5,7'. If you specify a numerical value, which is out of
                  range for the current system, the process is terminated and an 'Invalid argument' error message is displayed You can use `-proc'
                  as an abbreviation of `-processor'.
    +dp[=rsh|ssh] Enables you to set up distributed APS. This option can only be used with the +aps command-line option and is not supported in
                  the baseline mode. Use the rsh, ssh or autodetection methods to perform distributed processing. When using the rsh or ssh
                  methods, a list of machine names must be specified using the +hosts option. If no argument is specified with the +dp option, the
                  Spectre simulator will first check if the simulation is being controlled by LSF or Sun Grid Engine, and if so, will use LSF or
                  Sun Grid Engine to spawn any sub-processes. If LSF or Sun Grid Engine is not controlling the simulation, then the +dp option
                  will default to using rsh.
    +hosts "<hostname>: <number_of_cores>" 
                  Defines the machine specifications that will be used for distributed processing. This option must be used when you specify the
                  rsh or ssh values with the +dp option. The format of the machine specification is the same for both rsh and ssh. Each machine
                  specification, which, can be separated by the space delimiter contains the name of the machine and number of cores to be used on
                  the machine in the following format: "host_name:number_of_cores". For example, +hosts "hostA:4 hostB:4". This setting specifies
                  that four cores can be used on both hostA and hostB for performing the simulation.
    -interactive  Runs Spectre in the non-interactive mode, that is, processes the input file and then returns to the command prompt. You can use
                  `-inter' as an abbreviation of `-interactive'.
    +interactive  Runs Spectre in the default interactive mode. You can use `+inter' as an abbreviation of `+interactive'.
    +interactive=<type> 
                  Runs Spectre in the interactive mode based on the type specified. You can use `+inter' as an abbreviation of `+interactive'.
                  Possible values for `type' are skill and mpsc.
    +mpssession=<sessionName> 
                  Specifies the session name for running an interactive session using MPS.  This option must be specified when using the
                  +interactive=mpsc setting.
    +mpshost=<sessionHost> 
                  Specifies the name of the session host that will be used for running an interactive session using MPS.
    -64           Runs the 64-bit Spectre binary.
    -32           Runs the 32-bit Spectre binary.
    -mdlcontrol   Ignores the MDL control file. You can use `-mdl' as an abbreviation of `-mdlcontrol'.
    +mdlcontrol   Runs Spectre with the default MDL control file. You can use `+mdl' as an abbreviation of `+mdlcontrol'.
    +mdlcontrole  Runs Spectre with the default MDL control file. You can use `+mdle' as an abbreviation of `+mdlcontrole'.
    =mdlcontrol <file> 
                  Specifies the location for the MDL control file. You can use `=mdl' as an abbreviation of `=mdlcontrol'.
    =mdlcontrole <file> 
                  Specifies the location for the MDL control file. You can use `=mdle' as an abbreviation of `=mdlcontrole'.
*   -checklimitfile <file> 
                  Writes assert violations in the specified file. In `file', %C is replaced by the circuit name. You can use `-cl' as an
                  abbreviation of `-checklimitfile'.
*   -dochecklimit Disables the checklimit capability. You can use `-docl' as an abbreviation of `-dochecklimit'.
*   +dochecklimit Enables the checklimit capability. You can use `+docl' as an abbreviation of `+dochecklimit'.
*   -dynchecks    Disables the dynchecks capability.
*   +lqtimeout <value> 
                  Specifies the duration (in seconds) for which Spectre should wait to retrieve a license. When set to 0, Spectre waits until the
                  license is available. You can use `+lqt' as an abbreviation of `+lqtimeout'.
*   +lqsleep <value> 
                  Specifies the wait duration between two attempts made by Spectre to check out a license when queuing. Setting the value to a
                  positive number overrides the default wait duration of 30 seconds. You can use `+lqs' as an abbreviation of `+lqsleep'.
*   +lqmmtoken    Enables queuing for token license capability. When specified, Spectre registers the token request with the license server and
                  waits for authorization. In addition, Spectre ignores all non-token licenses during the wait time since only token licenses are
                  queued.
    +lsuspend     Enables the license suspend/resume capability. When Spectre receives SIGTSTP, it checks in all the licenses before it gets
                  suspended. The licenses are checked out again when SIGCONT is received. You can use `+lsusp' as an abbreviation of `+lsuspend'.
    +lmode <value> 
                  Checks out the required licenses according to the specified value during the initialization phase. Possible values are '<num>'
                  and 'RF'. '<num>' is a numeric value greater than 1, which specifies the number of token licenses to be checked out together.
                  For example, to run APS with the multi-core option, specify '+lmode 4'. 'RF' checks out the required licenses for the RF
                  functionality. This value is case insensitive. If the simulation requires more licenses than specified using 'lmode', the
                  additional licenses are checked out after the initialization phase. 
*   +lorder <value> 
                  Specifies the license check out order. Values are case insensitive. Possible values are as follows: 
                  'PRODUCT': Spectre attempts to check out the product+options combination licenses only. 
                  'MMSIM': Spectre attempts to check out the Virtuoso_Multi_mode_Simulation (MMSIM) tokens only. 
                  'PRODUCT:MMSIM': Spectre attempts to check out product licenses first and then MMSIM tokens. 
                  'MMSIM:PRODUCT': Spectre attempts to check out MMSIM tokens first and then product licenses. 
                  Default is 'PRODUCT:MMSIM'.

    -rf_ahdl_functionality =value 
                  Specifies the value for AHDL functionality in RF analysis. Possible values are `141' or `151'. Default value is `151'. 
    -ahdllint[=value] 
                  Enable Verilog-A linter check. Possible values are 'no', 'warn', 'static', 'error', and 'force'. The default value is 'warn'.
                  This option is not available in Spectre base. It is available only in APS or XPS.
    -ahdllint_maxwarn[=value] 
                  Specifies the maximum number of Verilog-A linter warning messages to be reported by the simulator for each message ID. The
                  default value is 5.
    -ahdllint_summary_maxentries[=value] 
                  Specifies the maximum number of messages to display in dynamic linter summary. The default value is 25.
    -ahdllint_warn_id=value 
                  Specifies a message ID and applies the -ahdllint_maxwarn option only to the specified message ID. This option should always be
                  used with the -ahdllint_maxwarn option and should be directly specified after it in the command line, otherwise, the option will
                  be ignored.
    -ahdllint_log <file> 
                  Specifies the file name to which the Verilog-A linter messages need to be written. By default, Verilog-A linter messages are
                  written to the output log file.
    -ahdllibdir path 
                  The -ahdllibdir option redirects the library files generated by AHDL to the specified path. If both -ahdllibddir and -outdir
                  options are specified, the library files generated by AHDL will be stored in the path specified by the -ahdllibdir option and
                  other output files will be stored in the path specified by the -outdir option.
    -ahdlsourceramp 
                  Disables source ramping for Verilog-A models. Source ramping of Verilog-A models is enabled by default because it helps with
                  convergence for most designs. However, in certain corner cases, the default behavior could lead to convergence difficulties,
                  which can be avoided by using this option.
    -ahdlshipdbdir=<sharing_path> 
                  Specifies the sharing directory for Verilog-A library compilation. Given this option, the simulator would search for reusable
                  library in the <sharing_path>. If library is found, reuse it, otherwise, compile a new library in the local directory.
    -ahdlshipdbmode="read_only" or "create_or_update" 
                  Indicates whether needs create/update the library under <sharing_path> specified by -ahdlshipdbdir. "read_only" means not to
                  create/update, which is the default behavior for -ahdlshipdbdir appearing alone.  "create_or_update" means that if under
                  <sharing_path>, there isn't any library or the library is outdated, copy the newly-built library in local directory to
                  <sharing_path>.
    +errpreset=value 
                  Selects a predetermined collection of parameter settings. Possible values are 'liberal', 'moderate' and 'conservative'.
*   +aps          Enables APS mode.
*   +aps=value    Enables APS mode and overrides the errpreset value in all transient analyses to apply the specified value. Possible values are
                  `liberal' `moderate', and `conservative'.
*   ++aps         Enables ++aps mode. Unlike the +aps mode, the ++aps mode uses a different time-step control algorithm compared to Spectre. This
                  can result in improved performance, while satisfying error tolerances and constraints.
*   ++aps=value   Enables ++aps mode and overrides the errpreset value in all transient analyses to apply the specified value. Possible values are
                  'liberal', 'moderate' and 'conservative'.
    +ms           Enables XPS-MS mode.
    +xps          Enables XPS mode.
    +xps=s[value] Enables XPS SPICE Accurate mode. The optional value is the speed setting.
    +speed=value  The simulation group speed setting. The lower number means conservative setting.
    +query=value  Queries the recommended number of threads or the licenses that are required to run the simulation on the current machine or on
                  one with similar configuration. Possible values are 'mtinfo', 'meminfo', 'all', 'alllic', and 'tokenlic'. 'mtinfo' prints the
                  recommended number of threads, 'meminfo' prints the memory usage estimate, 'all' prints the recommended number of threads and
                  the memory usage estimate, 'alllic' prints all possible license combinations for the design used for simulation and 'tokenlic'
                  prints the number of MMSIM tokens required. The default value is 'tokenlic'.
    +liclog       Writes the license check-in and check-out information in the log file.
    +disk_check[=value] 
                  Suspend the simulation when available disk storage is less than N bytes. Here, N is the value specified using the optional
                  [=value] of +disk_check or netlist option 'disk_check_thresh'. For example, +disk_check=1e10.
    -clearcache   Clear spectre cache directory "/home/<username>/.cadence/mmsim/". You can use `-cc' as an abbreviation of `-clearcache'.
    -disableCPP   Disable cpp preprocess for situation that spectre implicit call cpp such as -I and -D. However, if explicit specified -E,
                  -disableCPP will not take effect.
    +dcopt        The dcopt option speeds up the DC simulation in Spectre and APS for post-layout circuits that 
          consist of a large number of parasitic resistors and capacitors, which require significant 
          time in DC simulation. It can also be used to solve the non-convergence issues in DC simulations
          of any other circuit

          Note: In some cases, the DC solution obtained using the dcopt command-line option may not be as accurate as the true DC solution.
    +lite         Enables a lightweight simulation session where most or all of the computationally intensive features (device check asserts, info
                  analysis, current probing, power probing, instance preservation, ...) are turned off. By default, ++aps is used as the
                  simulation engine. This can be a very useful tool in isolating the computational time used by simulation engine during a
                  simulation performance debugging.
*   +config <file> 
                  Add a config file to the list of config files.
*   =config <file> 
                  Will not include previous `+config'.
*   -config       Disables all config files.
    +top <value>  When you specify +top with a subcircuit name, all elements, models, and so on will be exposed to the top level and the
                  subcircuit will not exist anymore. As a result, instantiation from this subcircuit will be illegal. Instances inside the
                  subcircuit will automatically connect to the instance at the top level if they connect to the same node.
    -hpc          Disables the hpc option

Notes:
For +/- pairs of options, the default setting is listed first.
Options marked with * are set by default when the `spectre_DEFAULTS' or `SPECTRE_DEFAULTS' environment variable is specified.
